0,55,Check if it is moving left to right. They check blocks next to each other starting from the very left. If they don't swap go to the 2nd and 3rd blocks. If they do swap then check if there are any more swaps with previous blocks. Then go back to where you were.

2,72,"Step 1: Designate the leftmost object as Object A.<br><br>Step 2: Check if swapping Object A with its right neighbor is valid (based on a predefined rule, such as its weight).<br><br>If invalid, designate the right neighbor as the new Object A and repeat Step 2.<br><br>If valid, swap their positions, designate the swapped neighbor as Object B, note Object Aâ€™s position, and proceed to Step 3.<br><br>Step 3: Propagate Object B to the left, following the same logic as Step 2 but with two changes:<br><br>The goal direction is now left.<br><br>If a swap fails, assume Object B is sorted and return to Step 2 and remember Object A's position."
3,56,"Starting with the left-most block, click on the block and the one to its right. If they swap, try to swap the one that just moved with the one to the left. Continue until no more swaps occur, and then proceed to the right."
4,44,"Start by comparing the first two blocks. Then progress by comparing the blocks in the 2nd and 3rd position, and then the 3rd and 4th, and so on.<br><br>Whenever a swap happens, keep note of the ""leading"" block that was placed ahead (to the right). If a swap does not happen, the block on the right that was compared becomes the new ""leading"" block. The block that was just swapped behind the ""leading"" block then needs to be compared to the block behind it. If a swap happens, again compare it to the block behind it. Repeat this until a swap does not happen or until it is placed in the first position. Then return to your ""leading"" block and compare it to the block ahead of it."
5,37,"COMPARE TWO ITEMS UNTIL THEY STOP ROTATING, ONCE THEY STOP ROTATING CLICK ON THE ITEM IN WHICH YOU LEFT OFF TO COMPARE TO THE NEXT ITEM, AND CONTINUE UNTIL ITEMS STOP ROTATING"
6,66,Continue to swap pieces until you have put them as far to the left as they will allow.
7,60,"Click on the blocks in pairs from left to right.  If you find a pair that switches, go back and make sure none of the blocks behind switch, then continue where you left off, repeating the pattern."
8,35,"as you sort the gold blocks, compare them to the previous and next blocks to sort them."
9,75,"Select 2 blocks. It is recommended to start playing from left to right. Select the first and second block on the left and see whether they switch places. It is ok if they do or don't. Then select the 2nd and 3rd block. If they swap that means that Block 3 should be in Block 2's place. Now to make sure let's select Block 2 and Block 1. If they stay the same, no worries. If they swap places, that's ok. The goal of the game is to put the gold blocks in order. Repeat this method for every block. The goal is to order the blocks correctly with minimal attempts/moves. Good luck!"
10,52,"Instead of using a compare the first block to the second block, then compare the first block to the third block, etc., the Omgne Sort is a more direct and less repetitive sorting system which doesn't repeat steps over and over. The Omgne Sort compares the first block to the second and then the second to the third. Only when there is an actual block swap do you then go backwards in your possible swapping of blocks, i.e. if the fourth and fifth blocks swap, then you go backwards trying to swap blocks until they don't swap anymore."
11,30,check on patterns and learn to do them
12,76,Start left from right and if there is a change keep passing it to the left until it can not move anymore then move on to the next block 
13,62,Select items starting at the left and then to the immediate right select that item as well. If they switch places they are out of order. If they swap places proceed back to the left and see if they swap if they do continue that process until they don't switch places. Then go back and start again where you left off completing the same motion from above until no images change places. 
14,32,compare each with precious block after each swap
15,54,"Start on the first block and click the second. If nothing moves, moves on to the second block and do the same all the way down the line. If the block is sent back 1 when you click on it going forward, you must keep clicking on the block until its sent back (to the left) as far as it can go, then go back to where you were in the line of blocks and repeat the process."
16,43,"Start with the first block and move it to the right as far as it will go.  Then check all the blocks that moved against each other, moving them as necessary.  When nothing can move to the left, you've done it correctly."
17,31,compare each block with next if it swaps the recheck the previous blocks as well
18,64,go from left to right selecting 2 at a time.
19,42,Select 2 objects beside each other and see if they change position
20,73,Sort the heavy first by selecting and moving them the opposite way
21,36,"Quick Guide to Identifying Omgne Sort Patterns<br>Omgne Sort is all about efficiently sorting items by comparing pairs and swapping when necessary. To improve your accuracy and speed, here's a breakdown of key patterns:<br><br>1. Recognizing the Order of Items:<br>Least Out-of-Order: Only one swap is needed, meaning the items are almost sorted. Look for just one misplaced item.<br>Somewhat Out-of-Order: A few swaps are needed. The items are not far from sorted but have a few minor adjustments required.<br>Very Out-of-Order: Multiple swaps are needed to arrange the items in order. This means the items are fairly scrambled.<br>Most Out-of-Order: This requires the maximum number of swaps. Items are in a completely reversed or scrambled order.<br>2. Tips for Faster Sorting:<br>Start with the Extremes: Compare the items at the ends (heaviest vs. lightest) to get a sense of their order.<br>Minimize Comparisons: After each comparison, update the list to focus only on what still needs sorting.<br>Work in Small Sections: If you have 8 items, focus on smaller groups (like the first 3 or 4) to build a sorted base.<br>3. Practice Makes Perfect:<br>Familiarize Yourself with Patterns: Recognize when the arrangement is close to sorted and when it needs more adjustments.<br>Stay Calm and Focused: If you get stuck, step back and compare a new pair to continue the process."
22,68,"Hi Students. look out for the number of swaps in a sequence. If you swap in a rightly arranged sequence of 5 8 times, that's very out of order."
23,67,"Hi there, for every 5 item arranged, if you sort out items 7 out of 5 then its sure out of order."
24,57,The Omgne Sort patterns makes it easy for better understanding and accurate results<br>It is such an easy pattern mostly.<br>Usually in a numerical order.
25,71,"Hello Folks, don't forget to keep track of how the numbers are arranged."
26,51,move the animals randomly until they dont switch positions
27,70,"Hi There, look out for the pattern with the least swap."
28,69,"Hi There, the least number of swaps has the tendency for a correct order."
29,59,Try your best and click the ones to move them
